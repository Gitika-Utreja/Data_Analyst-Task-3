# Data_Analyst-Task-3
Design an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders.

I cleaned the original Product-Sales-Region data in Power Query—fixed data types, removed duplicates and blanks, trimmed text, and kept everything in a single table instead of creating separate dimension or fact tables.

I built key DAX measures such as Total Sales, Total Quantity, Average Discount %, and Returned Orders to power the visuals and KPIs.

I designed a two-page Power BI report: the first page gives an executive overview with KPI cards, a sales trend line, a 100 % stacked regional chart, and a product tree map with interactive slicers; the second page dives deeper with a region–store–product matrix, a salesperson performance bar chart, a returns-by-region view, and an optional sales-vs-discount combo chart.

I applied a consistent color theme, added slicers for easy filtering, and included page-navigation buttons so users can move smoothly between the two pages without needing a Power BI Service sign-in.
